Curse of the Golden Flower is like... a classic representation of uh... "blood is thicker than water". In the movie, the royal family's trifling-ness, sibling rivalries, parent favoritism, and assassination attempts ultimately leads to their demise... idk it's a really good movie and it's deep and sad lmao.

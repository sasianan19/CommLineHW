Coraline is a super creepy book about this young girl, Coraline, who is neglected by her busy parents. She ends up basically being stalked by this creepy lady/creature (who resides in their home) who attempts to groom her and use her etc. etc. Eventually Coraline defeats old lady and gets her parents back to being loving and attentive!
